# cs332_lab2
Program will tell user to enter 10 numbers
Will use insertion algorithm to sort numbes in ascending order
To compile I used gcc Wall -g lab02.c -o lab02 in the terminal
Once it's compiled I used ./lab02 which runs the lab
The program starts out by asking the user to enter 10 numbers.
the first loop is going to loop 10 times until all 10 enteries have been entered.
After that the second for loop sorts the enteries in ascending order using the insertion sort algorithm.
